                method have sprung up everywhere. A general sphere of interest known as <em>Personal Knowledge
                    Management</em> (or PKM for short) has evolved, as many people have come to realise the limitations
                of both out our own memory, and of conventional note-taking systems.

            <p>I first stumbled across the world of PKM when a friend was abuzz about a book by someone named SÃ¶nke
                Ahrens. He explained the gist of the system to me and, having just undertaken a challenging academic
                project myself and in need of a better way to keep track of things, I decided to grab

                and give the Zettelkasten method a try. After giving some of the various smartnotes applications out
                there a try, I settled on
                <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">Obsidian<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
                        viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"

                and immediately something magical happened. I noticed a radical increase in the rigour of my thinking,
                and ability to make connections between things over time. Over a period of two months I generated as
                many new ideas from my research as the previous eight. I was extracting much more value from the books I
                read in much less time. A lot of the friction in organising my notesâ€”which were previous scattered
                between half a dozen different notebooks at any time (or committed to memory ready to be forgotten when
                needed)â€”had vanished overnight.

        <section id="method">
            <h2 class="section-title">The Method</h2>
            <p>The core of the Zettelkasten method can be broken down into three steps, or connected practices:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Take <em>fleeting notes</em> as you go through the day. These are for immediate, short-term storage
                    of thoughts and ideas without worrying about whether they're particularly worth dedicating space in
                    your Zettelkasten to. Ideas are captured here to be sifted through and either refined into Zettels
                    or discarded as appropriateâ€”this means there should be as little friction involved in the capturing
                    of fleeting notes. I personally keep a cheap Â£1 notebook handy to scribble in whenever the need
                    strikes.</li>
                <li>Take <em>literature notes</em> as you consume content. Building a robust reference system helps
                    tremendously with managing bibliographical data in academic work, but it's also useful for personal
                    knowledge-work outside of academia, as keeping track of the sources that lead to our own ideas in
                    the first place helps make us better and more rigorous thinkers.</li>
                <li>Craft <em>permanent notes</em>, the actual meat of the Zettelkasten system. These are atomic ideas
                    that link to and from other notes. By atomic, what is meant is that a single Zettel should not
                    present multiple distinct ideas that could be better split into two or more smaller Zettels. The
                    power of each note is not in how much information it holds, but in its interrelationship with other
                    related notes via <em>links</em> to and from them.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Together these three practices capture the essence of the system. Many people implement this system the
                same way Luhmann himself did: with boxes of index cards. I personally enjoy leveraging all the goodies
                the digital world brings us and use a smartnotes app for my Zettelkasten. Digital notes don't have to be
                small enough to fit on a single index card, can support massive amounts of bi-directional linking
                without becoming cluttered, and don't require arbitrary indexing numbers to reference one another.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section id="benefits">
            <h2 class="section-title">Benefits</h2>
            <p>What are some of the benefits of building a 'second brain'?</p>
            <p>For a start, traditional note-taking is <em>linear</em>â€”notes are generally organised chronologically, in
                the order they were written. Even if they are organised in a folder, we tend at best group notes by
                related <em>topics</em>, which is itself not ideal as it forces a <em>top-down</em>, hierarchical
                structure to our notes. In contrast, the Zettelkasten is a non-hierarchical, <em>bottom-up</em> system.
                Notes are not organised, they are simply created and then linked together over time. In a digital
                system, notes can be linked to long before even being created, and many people (myself included) use
                this as a way to allow topics to organically emerge. If certain notes are attracting a conspicuous
                amounts of backlinks, that is often a good sign they represent emergent topics, and could be promoted to
                become <em>Maps of Content</em>, or 'MoCs' for short.
            </p>
            <p>As a consequence of its linearity, the conventional practice of writing things down in notebooks creates
                a body of notes which becomes harder to meaningfully search as it increases in size. We don't write
                things down to remember them, but to forget them. The <em>retreievability</em> of things when we need
                them is therefore one of the most important metrics to assess a note-taking system by, and it is here
                that the Zettelkasten method excels. Notes become more deeply interlinked over time as more connections
                between them are realised, and the system becomes more useful as it grows, rather than less.
            </p>
            <p>Both Luhmann and Ahrens insist upon the importance of manually writing out brief summaries of the most
                important points of things we read or otherwise consume, so we are forced to translate ideas into our
                own words. Adopting this practice acts as a sort of
                <a href="https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/" target="_blank">Feynman technique<svg

                        stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="external">

                in miniature, embedded within the Zettelkasten method. This step is what makes literature notes not just
                a useful store of bibliographical data, but a tool to help us integrate the ideas we learn and make them
                our own.

        <section id="graph">
            <h2 class="section-title">Graphs</h2>
            <p>Viewing the organisation of your notes graphically is one of the most satisfying features offered by
                digital smartnotes applications. Aside from offering insight into emerging topics by making it visually
                clear which notes are attracting conspicuous numbers of links, they also look <em>really damn cool</em>.
            </p>
            <figure class="image-box">
                <img src="images/graph-view.png" alt="my obsidian vault's graph view" class="image" />
                <figcaption>The inside of my vault.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>As you can see from this graph of the inside of my vault, there is an enormously dense central cluster,
                with a sparser ring of notes around the outside. That central cluster contains all the notes from a
                musical project I worked on last autumn, which happened to deal with a vast amount of highly interlinked
                data. This visualisation was incredibly helpful when organising things, and seeing where connections
                were broadly coming from and going to without having to look at individual pages while doing mental
                arithmetic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Obsidian also has powerful filtering and search options (including support for <em>regular
                    expressions!</em>), so
                you can easily hide the things you don't want to see and focus on just the immediately salient
                connections between notes you're interested in.
