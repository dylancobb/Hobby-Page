# Planning
I decided to make a page about Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) in Obsidian.
Design decisions:
- Font selection: I went with Domine for the title and Open Sans for the body text, as I feel they make a nice aesthetic pairing appropriate for this kind of topic, and both are free web fonts.
- Colour scheme: an off-white text color on a dark brown background to match the colour scheme of my Obsidian vault seemed logical.
# Building
- I set up the standard boilerplate HTML code and created a CSS stylesheet for the site.
- Initially I used some dummy text while making basic typography and colour scheme decisions, and to help plan the layout for the final page.
